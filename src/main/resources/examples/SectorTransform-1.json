The EF should be used to report on consumption of procured materials based on their origin (that is comprised of primary material or recycled materials). For primary materials these factors cover the extraction/primary processing/manufacturing and transportation materials to the point of sale not the materials in use. For secondary materials the factors cover sorting/processing/manufacturing and transportation to the point of sale not the materials in use.
